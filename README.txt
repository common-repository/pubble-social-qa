If you are installing on a Wordpress blog or Website, choose the 'Install Code' option for WordPress (just click the WordPress logo). You will then need to complete 3 steps:

1 Install Pubble Social Q&A plugin from the WP admin section.As shown in the image, Click "Plugins" >click "Add New"> search "Pubble"

2 Pubble Social Q&A plugin will be listed >click "Install Now"

3 Click Settings of Pubble Q&A plugin.

4 You can add Pubble to your WP site in one of two ways. The default set up is to add Pubble across your complete site (in one go) however you also have the option to override this and add Pubble manually to specific pages if required. To do this, you simply add the code to each page you require Q&A to appear on.
To configure these settings, see options below;

4.1 Your "AppID" – make sure you input your appID here.
4.2 “Manual Q&A”: Pubble’s Q&A is an alternative solution designed to replace WP comments module. As explained above, the default setting is to deployQ&A across your site i.e. wherever you have previously enabled commenting on your site. If you select "Manual Q&A" option, you can manually add Q&A to selected pages instead of across your whole site.
4.3 Q&A layout: Two options to choose from (i) "Embedded" option - display your Q&A on your page or (ii) "Modalbox" option– display your Q&A in a Pop Up box. You can switch these settings in your admin panel later if required.
4.4 List same question across your site: Once you select this feature, Pubble will list the same set of questions across your sites. The default setting is for different pages to have its own set of questions which relate to the content of each page.
4.5 Make sure your Pubble Q&A plugin is active!

5 Optional Step: If you need to add Q&A to specific pages (instead of all pages), you need to tick “Manual Q&A” box as mentioned in 4.2 above. Then, simply add the Pubble code to pages where you need our Social Q&A features in HTML mode. The Pubble system will use your WordPress Article ID as the default identifier for each page.


For Custom clients (i.e. Paid for platforms) if you want to include multipleQ&A app’s, please add the following Pubble code to your pages in HTML mode.In this instance, please make sure you change the following“change_to_appID” to a real “AppID” (as detailed in 4.1 above)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q: Does Pubble have a free plan?

A: Yes. See details on: <a href='http://www.pubble.co/community/get-started' target="_blank" style='text-decoration:none;'>Get Started </a>

Q: What is pubble Q&A all about?

A: Pubble is about helping sites to create communities online, and also about helping people to get answers to commonly asked questions, using "The world's best FAQ" We are rolling out new features so we'll keep you informed as we grow!

Q: Do you support custom styling?

A: Yes. You can customise the look and feel to match the style of your WordPress blog / site.

Q: Do you support moderation?

A: Yes. You can assign moderators right down to the individual page level.

Q: Does Pubble help with my SEO?

A: Yes. We get this question a lot. Google will index the threads in the plugins directly but if you wish, we also support options for you to include the Q&A threads (content) natively on your pages.

Q: Are questions answered in realtime?

A: Depends on how quick the moderator can type! Pubble supports realtime posting for Questions and Answers.

Q: How does this work? It is a plugin?

A: Yes. We support various "plugin" options depending on which platform that you run your site on. 

Q: How does this differ from WordPress Comments?

A: Commenting and Q&A might look similar when they are presented in the threaded layout that Pubble supports. However, the purpose of Q&A is very different to Commenting. For example, some people will want to add their question privately. Pubble supports this. For moderators, they get tired of answering the same questions over and over. To reduce duplicate questions, Pubble includes an answer prompt for questions that have already been answered. Such functionality would be totally at odds with what a commenting platform is designed to achieve.

Q: Does Pubble support social sharing?

A: Yes. Questions or answers can be tweeted / posted to Facebook / shared to LinkedIn.

Q: How to disable Pubble QA in specfic pages?

A: You can directly disable pubble Q&A on individual wordpress pages and posts. Here's how:

1. Go to pages in wordpress.

2. Click on any one page (ie about)

3. Click on 'Screen Options' at the top and enable the 'Discussion' option.

4. At the bottom of the page you will have a 'Discussion' window with an 'Allow Comments' option. Simply uncheck that and all is fine.

You can use the same procedure to disable comments on any post. The confusing thing is only that Wordpress hides the Discussion options on page and posts pages by default.
